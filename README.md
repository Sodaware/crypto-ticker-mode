## Configuration

By default, **crypto-ticker-mode** is configured to fetch the latest
Dogecoin/USD exchange rate from the [CoinGecko](https://coingecko.com/) public API.


### Configuring the Display

To change the displayed currency symbols, modify the following variable:

* `crypto-ticker-mode-currency-from-symbol` - This is the starting currency,
  such as BTC or DOGE.
* `crypto-ticker-mode-currency-to-symbol` - The currency being converted to,
  such as $ or Â£.

**NOTE** - Changing the symbols does not change the actual rate calculation.


### Other Configuration Options

**crypto-ticker-mode** also provides the following configuration options:

* `crypto-ticker-mode-api-poll-interval` - The number of seconds the ticker will
  wait between rate checks. By default this is 10 minutes.

* `crypto-ticker-mode-symbol-increased` - The symbol that displays in the
  modeline when the exchange rate has increased. This is an up-arrow by default.

* `crypto-ticker-mode-symbol-decreased` - The symbol displayed in the modeline
  when the exchange rate has decreased. This is a down-arrow by default.

* `crypto-ticker-mode-symbol-same` - Displayed when the price hasn't
  changed. This is a dash by default.


### Configuring the CoinGecko Driver

To change the displayed exchange rate, the following variables should be
modified:

* `crypto-ticker-mode-driver-coingecko-from-currency` - The coin to convert
  from. This will be something like "dogecoin" or "bitcoin". Defaults to "dogecoin".
* `crypto-ticker-mode-driver-coingecko-to-currency` - The currency to convert to
  to. Defaults to "usd".


### Changing Drivers

To change the driver, set the `crypto-ticker-mode-driver` variable to be a valid
function that returns the current exchange rate. 


### Usage Example

The following configuration would display the current Bitcoin/USD exchange rate:

```el
;; Require the extension and driver.
(require 'crypto-ticker-mode)
(require 'crypto-ticker-mode-driver-coingecko)

;; Configure the display.
(setq crypto-ticker-mode-from-symbol "BTC")
(setq crypto-ticker-mode-to-symbol   "$")

;; Configure the driver.
(setq crypto-ticker-mode-driver-coingecko-from-currency "bitcoin")
(setq crypto-ticker-mode-driver-coingecko-to-currency   "usd")

;; Enable the mode.
(crypto-ticker-mode)
```
