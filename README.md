## Configuration

By default, **crypto-ticker-mode** is configured to fetch the latest
Dogecoin/USD exchange rate from the [Cryptsy](http://cryptsy.com/) public API.

### Configuring the Display

To change the displayed currency symbols, modify the following variable:

* `crypto-ticker-mode-currency-from-symbol` - This is the starting currency,
  such as BTC or DOGE.
* `crypto-ticker-mode-currency-to-symbol` - The currency being converted to,
  such as $ or Â£.

**NOTE** - Changing the symbols does not change the actual rate calculation.


### Configuring the Cryptsy Driver

To change the displayed exchange rate, the following variable should be
modified:

* `crypto-ticker-mode-driver-cryptsy-market-id` - This is the Cryptsy market ID
  to fetch data for. A full list of markets can be found on the Cryptsy
  homepage.


### Example

The following configuration would display the current Bitcoin/USD exchange rate:

```lisp
(setq crypto-ticker-mode-from-symbol "BTC")
(setq crypto-ticker-mode-to-symbol "$")
(setq crypto-ticker-mode-driver-cryptsy-market-id 2)
```
